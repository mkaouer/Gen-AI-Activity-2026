A portfolio website is an essential tool for showcasing your skills, projects, and achievements to colleges, scholarship committees, and future employers. By the end of this session, you will have a personalized website that you can continue to update and improve.

This activity uses two cutting-edge AI tools from Google: **Google Gemini** for reasoning and content generation, and **Jules** for agentic programming. Together, these tools will help you transform your resume into a beautiful, functional website without writing a single line of code from scratch.
